# commands.py




#   i was trying to fix  whn a user picks prviously picked number.
#   i fixed it but did not check it. chck that
#   i tried to implemeent a gameoveer cases but i think only the simple case is implmented
#   but even i did not check that so chck it. if works check the othr cases also. 
#   if not implmnted then implement it. refeer back the prompt chatgpt give me then ask that
#   i want to implment users can direecttly play from the private chat
#   but as the game is in group chat so i need to forward the meessages to the group automatically
#   this is becuase it is good if thee user directly plays whilee seeing thee card
#   otherwise the game will not be that fun and players frustrate going here nad there to mark and to see thir card
